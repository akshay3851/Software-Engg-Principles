## Introduction
Understanding and applying software engineering principles and clean code practices is crucial for developing high-quality software. This repository aims to provide a comprehensive guide to these principles and practices, helping developers improve their code quality and maintainability.

## Software Engineering Principles
1. **Modularity**
2. **Abstraction**
3. **Encapsulation**
4. **Separation of Concerns**
5. **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)**
6. **Open/Closed Principle (OCP)**
7. **Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)**
8. **Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)**
9. **Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)**
10. **DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)**
11. **KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid)**
12. **YAGNI (You Aren’t Gonna Need It)**
13. **SOLID Principles**

## Clean Code Practices
1. **Meaningful Names**
2. **Functions Should Do One Thing**
3. **Use Comments Wisely**
4. **Consistent Coding Style**
5. **Error Handling**
6. **Avoid Magic Numbers and Strings**
7. **Write Tests**
8. **Refactoring**
9. **Code Reviews**
10. **Keep It Simple (KISS)**
11. **YAGNI (You Aren’t Gonna Need It)**
12. **Avoid Premature Optimization**
13. **Modular Design**
14. **Consistent Naming Conventions**
15. **Readable Code**

## Examples
Provide examples of good and bad code, demonstrating the application of these principles and practices.
